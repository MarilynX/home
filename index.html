			Riddles are by definition a question or statement intentionally phrased so as to require ingenuity in attaining its answer or meaning, typically presented as a game. The objective is always to come up with the correct answer. Now these are not to be confused with puzzles. Riddles and puzzles are NOT the same thing. Riddles are meant to be verbal enigmas. Though the word can be a synonym for puzzle when used as an adjective, it is not so when it is used as a noun. Jokes are also not the same thing as a riddle. There are three main categorizations of riddles.</p>
