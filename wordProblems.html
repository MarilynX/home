		<p class="text">Word problems are lengthy and paragraph like. They are often presented by narration and depict a scene or situation. After the setting is established, a problem or question is poised. They are often open ended with multiple answers that fit the description. Some of them can be rather intelligent, while others are less so. Examples of these can be found below.</p>
		
		<p class="question"> Q. A king has no sons, no daughters, and no queen. For this reason he must decide who will take the throne after he dies. To do this he decides that he will give all of the children of the kingdom a single seed. Whichever child has the largest, most beautiful plant will earn the throne. At the end of the contest all of the children came to the palace with their enormous and beautiful plants in hand. After he looks at all of the children's pots, he finally decides that the little girl with an empty pot will be the next Queen. Why did he choose this little girl over all of the other children with their beautiful plants?</p>
		
		<p class="answer"> A. The king gave them all fake seeds and the little girl was the only honest child who didn't switch seeds.</p>
		
		<p class="question"> Q. A thief enters a shop and threatens the clerk, forcing him to open the safe. The clerk says, "The code for the safe is different every day, and if you hurt me you'll never get the code". But the thief manages to guess the code on his own How did he do it?</p> 
		
		<p class="answer">A. The code is "different." The clerk told him this.</p>
		
		<p class="question">Q. Two fathers and their two sons go fishing together. They each catch one fish to take home with them. They do not lose any fish, and yet when they arrive at home they only have three fish. How can this be?</p>
		
		<p class="answer">A. There are just three people. A grandfather, his son, and his grandson.</p>
